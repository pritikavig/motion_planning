*Note* on harder environments, code may take a minute or more to find path.
This code assumes Java 8 and the ability to run java applications. 

The problem set up in the driver is default to the PRM map. Other cases can be run by switching the following variables. 






To run the PRM:
	PlANAR_ROBOT in the driver to false
	Set the defaultSize to 1000

To run the RRT:
	PLANAR_ROBOT in the driver to true
	set the defaultSize to 20000

To run the modified RRT:
	Follow instructions for RRT
	Set the defaultSize to 50000
	Set the variable ALTER_RRT in RRTPlanner.java to true.
